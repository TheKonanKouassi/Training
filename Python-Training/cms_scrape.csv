But which files get added? Well, that is up to us. In this video, we will look at the different options for using the add command and how we can use it to add the exact files we would like to the staging area.

Python: Comprehensions – How they work and why you should be using them,"Python comprehensions are a very natural and easy way to create lists, dicts, and sets. They are also a great alternative to using maps and filters within python. If you are using maps, filters, or for loops to create your lists, then most likely you could and should be using comprehensions instead.

Sublime Text Quick Tip: Launch Sublime Text from the Terminal,"If you navigate from your terminal frequently, you have most likely run into the scenario where you are within a project directory and want to open a file or folder from that project. It is a pain to open up Finder, navigate to the project, and open the file or directory that way. Being able to open these projects and files from the terminal is much more convenient and saves a lot of time. In this video we’ll look at how we can do just that:

"How Web Developers, Designers, Programmers, and Software Engineers can volunteer their skills and give back to the community","In this article, I wanted to talk about volunteering and different ways for Web Developers, Designers, Programmers, and Software Engineers to give back to their community using their skill-set.

There’s a great line in the book “Tuesdays with Morrie” when the main character was talking about giving back to your community. He talks about not giving back with money, but with your skill-set. Here’s the line from that book:
I don’t mean money. I mean your time… It’s not so hard. There’s a senior center that opened near here. Dozens of elderly people come there every day. If you’re a young man or young woman and you have a skill, you are asked to come and teach it. Say you know computers. You come there and teach them computers. You are very welcome there. And they are very grateful. This is how you start to get respect, by offering something that you have.
I couldn’t agree with this more. Sharing a skill you have not only helps others, but it will help you hone your own skills as well.
This got me thinking, what are different ways in which our tech community can volunteer their skills, give back, and have a positive impact on the world?

Python: virtualenv and why you should use virtual environments,"In this video, we will be looking at virtualenv and why you should be using virtual environments in Python. Virtual Environments in Python allow us to keep project-specific dependencies in a separate place than our global site-packages. This is extremely useful when you have different versions of packages for different projects.

Here’s a brief walkthrough of some of the code from the video:
Install virtualenv
pip install virtualenv
Create a location for your environments (Optional)
mkdir ~/Environments
cd ~/Environments
Create a new virtual environment (called venv for this example)
virtualenv venv
Activate your new virtual environment
source venv/bin/activate
At this point you can work from inside of your new virtual environment and know that you are keeping your project-specific packages and dependencies separate.
When you are finished, you can deactivate your virtual environment
deactivate
If you no longer need your environment and would like to delete it, you can just remove the directory
rm -rf venv

CSS Tips and Tricks: Add External URLs to Print Stylesheets,"Printing out URLs can be a nice edition to print stylesheets. When someone prints your article or blog post, you want them to know where your links would have taken them so that they can investigate those sources further if they desire.

So how do we add only the external links to the print stylesheet? In this video, we will cover several techniques you can use in order to achieve this.

Quick Tip: Use a Wooden Pallet as a Lumber Rack,"Making a lumber rack for the workshop is a task I’ve been putting off for a long time now. As I was cleaning up my shop the other day, I decided I needed to come up with a temporary solution for the pile of lumber on my floor. I’ve had an old wooden pallet in the corner of my shop for some time, so I decided to start loading what I could onto that. It was surprisingly more spacious and sturdy than I had first anticipated.

I loaded as many boards as would fit onto the pallet. There weren’t many left after I was finished. Since the walls in my shop can’t support heavy racks hanging on the walls, this is a nice simple and cheap solution for the time being.

This solution works best for long, thin boards. The nice thing is that you can still slide larger panels in behind the pallet for additional storage.

Adding Custom Web Fonts to Your Web Site Using CSS Font-Face,"Adding custom web fonts to your website is one of those things that seems like it should be easier than it actually is. In this video tutorial, we’ll walk through how to add a custom font to your website using the FontSquirrel.com Web Font Generator. Let’s Get Started:

Additional Information
Let’s look further into the CSS @font-face rule generated by FontSquirrel:
@font-face {
    font-family: 'source_sans_proregular';
    src: url('sourcesanspro-regular-webfont.eot');
    src: url('sourcesanspro-regular-webfont.eot?#iefix') format('embedded-opentype'),
         url('sourcesanspro-regular-webfont.woff') format('woff'),
         url('sourcesanspro-regular-webfont.ttf') format('truetype'),
         url('sourcesanspro-regular-webfont.svg#source_sans_proregular') format('svg');
    font-weight: normal;
    font-style: normal;
}
The top line of the @font-face rule is “font-family”. This is the name we are assigning to our custom font. It can be anything we choose. If we wanted, we could rename the font to something easier to remember and use that throughout our CSS.
